    <h class="text-xl font-semibold"><span class="underline">Question-1</span> : Discuss the scope of var, let, and
        const</h><br><br>

    <p class=""> (1).<span class="font-bold">var</span> has function scope and is hoisted, allowing reassignment within
        and outside blocks.<br><br>
        (2).<span class="font-bold">let</span> has block scope, is hoisted, prevents variable redeclaration, and allows
        reassignment within its block.<br><br>
        (3).<span class="font-bold">const</span> has block scope, is hoisted, prevents variable redeclaration, and is
        immutable after assignment, unless
        assigned to objects or arrays, allowing property or element modification.</p><br><br><br>


    <h class="text-xl font-semibold"><span class="underline">Question-2</span> :Tell us the use cases of null and
        undefined</h>
    <br><br>

    <p class="font-bold">Use cases of undefined:</p>
    <p>
        1. Variable Initialization: It represents variables that have been declared but not yet assigned a value.<br>
        2. Function Parameters: It can be used to check if a function parameter has been provided.<br>
        3. Object Properties: When accessing non-existent object properties, they return undefined.<br>
        4. Default Function Return Value: Functions that do not return explicitly have an implicit return of
        undefined.<br>
        5. Empty Array Slots: Unassigned array elements contain undefined.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="font-bold">Use cases of undefined:</p>
    <p>
        1. Intentional Absence of Value: It is used to indicate that a variable or object property should intentionally
        have no value.<br>
        2.Clearing a Variable or Object Property: It can be assigned to a variable or object property to clear or reset
        it to no value.<br>
        3. Sentinel Value: It's sometimes used as a placeholder to signify missing data or unavailable values in
        specific use cases.<br>
    </p> <br><br>

    <h class="text-xl font-semibold"><span class="underline">Question-2</span> :What do you mean by REST API?</h>
    <br><br>

    <p>
        1. Resources: In a RESTful architecture, resources are the key abstractions that clients interact with. These
        resources can represent entities like objects, data, or services.<br>

        2. HTTP Verbs (Methods): REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform CRUD
        (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. These methods are used to indicate the desired action on
        a resource.<br>

        3. Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Each resource is identified by a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier),
        which is used to access and manipulate the resource. URIs provide a consistent way to locate and address
        resources.<br>

        4. Statelessness: A RESTful API is stateless, which means that each request from a client to a server must
        contain
        all the information needed to understand and process the request. There should be no session state stored on the
        server between requests.<br>

        5. Representation: Resources can have multiple representations (e.g., JSON, XML, HTML) that can be used for data
        exchange between the client and the server. Clients can specify the desired representation using the Accept
        header in the request.
